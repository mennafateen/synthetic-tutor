"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!” thought Lucy, going still further in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet.\n“I wonder is that more moth-balls?” she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hand. But instead of feeling the hard. smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. “This is very queer,” she said, and went on a step or two further.\n\nNext moment she found that what she was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. “Why, it is just like branches of trees!” exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.\n\nLucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She looked back over her shoulder and there, between the dark tree trunks, she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out. (She had, of course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.) It seemed to be still daylight there.\n\n“I can always get back if anything goes wrong,” thought Lucy. She began to walk forward, crunch-crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light. In about ten minutes she reached it and found it was a lamp-post.\n\nAs she stood looking at it, wondering why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter patter of feet coming towards her. And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.\nHe was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella, white with snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shaped like a goat's (the hair on them was glossy black) and instead of feet he had goat's hoofs.","What do you think was the soft, powdery and cold thing Lucy felt?",Snow,A,Snow,Mothballs,Feathers

"The Traveler
A man who had traveled far and wide came home to his
small village. He gathered the villagers together to tell them of
all the wonderful things he had done in all the places he had
visited.
In Russia, he had cut bricks of ice and built a palace. In
China, he had flown the best dragon kite anyone had ever
seen. In Africa, he had chased a lion. In Australia, he had
jumped farther than the kangaroos. He had jumped farther than
any man alive.
The villagers listened with interest at first, and then began

Australia, and show us.”","Why did the traveler gather the villagers together to tell about his
travels?",,A,He wanted them to admire him.,He wanted to make them laugh.,They thought the traveler was a famous man.
"The Traveler
A man who had traveled far and wide came home to his
small village. He gathered the villagers together to tell them of
all the wonderful things he had done in all the places he had
visited.
In Russia, he had cut bricks of ice and built a palace. In
China, he had flown the best dragon kite anyone had ever
seen. In Africa, he had chased a lion. In Australia, he had
jumped farther than the kangaroos. He had jumped farther than
any man alive.

"As you read about sound, pay attention to the underlined words, and any hints to
the meaning of these words.
What is Sound?
The world around us is filled with sound. There are loud sounds
and soft sounds. There are pleasant sounds and unpleasant sounds.
At this very moment, you are surrounded by sound. Where does
sound come from? How does it get to your ears? Why are there
different kinds of sound? The study of these questions about sound is
called **acoustics**.
Imagine a cymbal hit with a drumstick. The cymbal shakes rapidly,
and this **vibration** causes the tiny particles in the air around it to
vibrate. These vibrating air particles, called **molecules**, bump into the
air particles next to them and make them vibrate. This spreading
vibration moves outward in every direction from the cymbal in waves.
When a small object is made to vibrate, the sound waves move up
and down very quickly. This produces a **high-pitched** sound, like a
high note in a song. When a large object is made to vibrate, the sound
waves move up and down more slowly. This produces a **low-pitched**
sound, like a low note in a song. Hitting a small cymbal makes a more
high-pitched sound than hitting a large cymbal.
The **volume** of a sound depends upon the amount of **energy**, or
force, applied to the object that is caused to vibrate. If the cymbal is hit
very hard with the drumstick, the volume of the sound is louder than if
it is hit lightly. The sound wave created by a hard hit carries the
energy of the hit along with it. When a sound wave hits an object, the
force that the sound wave carries causes movement in the object it
hits. An extremely loud sound wave, such as the sound of thunder,
can actually make the ground shake.",Select which context clues give a hint to the meaning of acoustics,,C,…filled with sounds…,…surrounded by sound…,…study of…

"How We Hear Sounds
When a sound is created, it travels from its source in waves, called
sound waves. Different **sources**, or causes, of sounds create different
kinds of sound waves. The part of the ear that is outside our head is called
the **pinna**. The pinna helps to catch the sound waves around us and guide
them inside the ear. As a sound wave enters the ear, it hits the eardrum.
The **eardrum** is a thin layer of skin called a **membrane** that separates the
outer ear from the middle ear. The eardrum is stretched tight, like the top
of a drum, causing it to vibrate when sound waves hit it.
Just behind the eardrum are three tiny bones called **the hammer, the
anvil, and the stirrup**. These are the smallest bones in the human body. All
together, they are no larger than a pea. When a sound wave hits the
eardrum, it begins to vibrate and press back against the tiny bones in the
inner ear. The bones pick up the sound wave and pass it on into the inner
ear. In the inner ear, a spiral-shaped tube called the **cochlea** carries the
sound wave along and transforms it into the kind of energy that the brain
can detect.
From the moment the sound was created—by a car horn, or a dog’s
bark, or a whistle—the sound wave has a certain pattern that is different
from other sound wave patterns. This pattern never changes as the sound
wave travels through the air, hits the ear drum, moves on to the middle and
inner ear. The pattern of the sound wave tells the brain what caused the
sound.",Select which context clues give a hint to the meaning of Sources,,B,…travels from…,…or causes…,…different kinds…

"The Water Cycle
You can’t see it, but the water **cycle** is always in motion on

As water goes through this cycle, it is sometimes solid ice,
sometimes liquid water, and sometimes a gas called water
**vapor**.
The energy that drives the water cycle is heat. When heat
is added to ice, the ice melts into water. When heat is added to
water, it **evaporates**, turning from liquid into gas. When heat is
taken away from water vapor, it **condenses**, turning from gas
into liquid. When heat is taken away from water, it freezes,
turning from liquid to solid.

rivers. The water changes into water vapor that rises into the
air. High above the earth, the water vapor cools and becomes

"The Water Cycle
You can’t see it, but the water **cycle** is always in motion on
the earth. This series of events goes round and round, again
and again, providing clean, fresh water for the land and seas.
As water goes through this cycle, it is sometimes solid ice,
sometimes liquid water, and sometimes a gas called water
**vapor**.
The energy that drives the water cycle is heat. When heat
is added to ice, the ice melts into water. When heat is added to
water, it **evaporates**, turning from liquid into gas. When heat is
taken away from water vapor, it **condenses**, turning from gas
into liquid. When heat is taken away from water, it freezes,
turning from liquid to solid.
The heat from the sun warms the water in oceans and
rivers. The water changes into water vapor that rises into the
air. High above the earth, the water vapor cools and becomes
tiny **particles** of water that create clouds. As the clouds gather
more and more particles of water, the water falls as rain or
snow, which are two forms of **precipitation**. This precipitation is
absorbed in the ground or is added to the water in oceans,
lakes, and rivers. The cycle is always, constantly, in process,

"The Rock Cycle
Rock may seem to last forever, but it is actually always
changing. It is always in one of the stages of the rock **cycle**.
This series of events in the rock cycle takes thousands of
years. But the cycle is always in motion.
The pressure inside the earth produces enough heat to
melt the rock there. This melted rock, or **magma**, seeps up into
the top crust of the earth, or it erupts from volcanoes. In the
earth’s crust, and around the volcanoes, the magma cools into
solid rock. This kind of rock is called **igneous rock**.
Over time, igneous rock breaks down into smaller and
smaller pieces. This process, called **weathering**, produces soil,
or **sediment**.
Water and wind carry the bits of soil into piles called
sediment beds. This transportation of the soil to the sediment
beds is called **erosion**. As the sediment is pressed down by
more and more sediment on top, the lower levels turn into
**sedimentary rock**.
As more and more layers of sedimentary rock are formed,
the layers on the bottom are pushed down deeper. They grow
hot from the pressure. Finally, they are heated into magma, and
the cycle is complete—and ready to begin again.",Select which context clues give a hint to the meaning of cycle,,B,…one of the stages…,…series of events…,…thousands of years…
